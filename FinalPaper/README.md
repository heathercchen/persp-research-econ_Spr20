# Introduction for FinalPaper repo
1. The “Data” repository consists of all data after cleaning. The raw data for my paper is too big to upload.
2. The “Notebooks” repository has one R notebook for Logistic and Bayes Logistic analysis. The python notebook is used for data cleaning and remaining analysis.
